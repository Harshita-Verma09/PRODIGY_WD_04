            <h1>Music Player</h1>
            <p> Creating a basic music player using HTML and CSS involves structuring the player interface and styling
                its elements. Within the HTML file, you'd set up the player's layout using divs and include elements
                like buttons for play, pause, skip, a volume slider, and a track progress bar. Each element would have
                its corresponding class or ID for styling. Using CSS, you'd define the visual aspects. You could use CSS to customize
                the colors, sizes, and positioning of the player components, ensuring they align properly and have a
                cohesive look. Additionally, leveraging CSS, you might include hover effects or animations for a more
                engaging user experience. This combination of HTML for structuring and CSS for styling allows you to
                craft a simple yet visually appealing music player interface.
